# VARA-SITL-PX4
This work addresses the challenge of maintaining reliable, scalable, and fully distributed formation control for MASs in the presence of sever actuator faults and agent loss. A novel Virtual Anchor Reconfiguration Algorithm (VARA) is proposed that enables real-time, distributed formation adaptation when an agent becomes uncontrollable.
It is based on PX4 multi vehicles GAZEBO classic IRIS simulation with ROS1. The ROS version is Melodic running on ubunto 18.04. The reposatory of PX4 has a version of 13.x. The main DHOSMO code is written in Python.
